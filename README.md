# Schema Design
---
Create a database schema that will represent People, their Location, and their Interests. This database is intended to be used to connect individuals who are in the same location and share interests.

## Steps

1. Create the below ERD in PGAdmin with all of the columns listed. Use appropriate types for the data based on what you think that data represents.

2. Set all id fields to be autogenerated primary keys.
3. Add join columns and tables as dipicted to ensure that:
  - A Person can have any number of interests

9. Some users had birthdays and our app doesn't have a way to for them to update their age. They've sent in a request to the DB team, so we need to update the age of the following users (Add 1 to their age):
   
   | firstName  |  lastName  |
   | ---------- |  --------  |
   |  Chickie   |   Ourtic   |
   |  Winnie    |   Whines   |
   |  Edouard   |  Lorimer   |
   |  Courtney  |   Holley   |
   |  Melva     |   Lanham   |
   |    Isa     |   Slight   |
   |  Abbott    |  Fisbburne |
   |  Reeta     |   Sammons  |

10. We've recieved a few requests from users to delete their accounts. This functionality also hasn't been implemented in the app, so they've reached out to our team to remove all data for the following people (Don't forget to delete their interests from the Person_Interest table):

   | firstName  |  lastName  |
   | ---------- |  --------  |
   |  Hilton    |   O'Hanley |
   |  Alanna    |   Spino    |

11. Our business team wants to learn more about the people using our app. Write SELECT statements to gather the following information:
   - Get all the names (first and last) of the people using the application (Columns to SELECT = firstName & lastName)
   - Find all the people who live in Nashville, TN (Columns to SELECT = firstName, lastName, city, & state)
   - Use COUNT & GROUP BY to figure out how many people live in each of our four cities (Resulting Columns: city & count)
   - Use COUNT & GROUP BY to determine how many people are interested in each of the 7 interests (Resulting Columns: title & count)
   - Write a query that finds the names (first and last) of all the people who live in Nashville, TN and are interested in programming (Columns to SELECT = firstName, lastName, city, state, & interest title)
   - **OPTIONAL BONUS**: Use GROUP BY with cases to determine how many people there are in each of the following age ranges: 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 (Resulting Columns: range & count)
